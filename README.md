# Match3JavaProject
By Troels "Sheepyhead" Jessen
## Description
This repo contains a pet project attempt to create basic Match 3 mechanics, as part of a larger project to reinvent Puzzle Quest. It is programmer entirely in Java and built with Gradle, using the IntelliJ Idea IDE. At this time it uses no external libraries, although this is likely to change once the game logic needs to be embedded into an actual game.
